"# html_kids_stuff_06_Scroll_Animation" 
"In this project, we're going to build a scroll animation, which is is pretty simple.
However, it's very useful.
If I go and I start to scroll down, the content below comes in from the left, go down some more.
Next one comes in from the right and it's going to alternate where it comes in from.
I used JavaScript to basically tell where the trigger point is for the next box to come-in.

Thats all!
